## Description
￼
Cloud computing has revolutionized the computing landscape mainly due to key advantages to developers/users over pre-existing computing paradigms: 

1. Virtually unlimited scalability of resources, avoiding disruptive infrastructure replacements 
2. Utility-inspired pay-as-you-go and self-service purchasing model, minimizing capital expenditure 
3. Virtualization-enabled seamless usage and easier programming interfaces
4. Simple, portable internet service- based interfaces, straightforward for non expert users, enabling adoption and use of cloud services without any prior training. Still, Cloud computing relies nowadays on centralized architectures. This work pursues a shift in this paradigm .
